  <section>
  		<p>I am from the Northeast of China. I earned my Computer Science bachelor's degree in Oregon State University. I am a person who was dreaming to be a programmer that can help people to improve their life quality. Unfortunately, I am also a lazy programming learner which means I never advanced my programming skills in the past few years. I defined myself as a person who is "Jack of all trades, and master of none". However, I still believe I will acheived my dream eventually if I make changes at this moment.</p>
